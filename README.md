### Write an algorithm for accepting two numbers, divide the first number by second and display their quotient.

```
Step1:- Start the algorithm.
Step2:- Declare variables x and y. 
Step3:- Take inputs and store in variables x and y respectively.
Step4:- Declare variable z.
Step5:- Compare x to y, if x is greater than y. Divde x by y and store value at z.
Step6:- Compare x to y, if x is less than y. Divde y by x and store value at z.
Step7:- Print z.
Step8:- Stop the algorithm.
